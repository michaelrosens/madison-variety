                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>In 1976, Edward Rosenstraus took a leap of faith and opened up Madison Variety, a small shop with a big goal: to provide a little bit of everything to the Old Bridge community. What started as a simple family-run store quickly became a local staple, offering convenience and friendly service to neighbors and visitors alike.</p>
                    <p>As the years went by, Edward’s children grew up helping in the store, stocking shelves, assisting customers, and learning the values of hard work and dedication. By 1995, Madison Variety became a hub for commuters by offering bus tickets, making the daily journey to New York and Jersey City more convenient for hundreds of locals.</p>
                    <p>For nearly 50 years, Madison Variety has been more than just a store—it has been a safe haven for many in the community. Some of our customers have been relying on us for over 30 years, stopping by daily for their morning coffee, a friendly chat, or simply the comfort of a familiar place. Through economic ups and downs, changing trends, and evolving customer needs, Madison Variety has remained a trusted part of Old Bridge's daily life.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, Gabe Rosenstraus took the reins, carrying on his father’s vision and ensuring that the store continued to serve Freehold with the same warmth and reliability that had defined it from the start. We’re proud of our journey and grateful for the continued support of our community. As we look to the future, we remain committed to serving Freehold with the same dedication and variety that has made Madison Variety a part of local history for generations.</p>
